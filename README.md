# FS2 AWS Utilities

[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Dwolla/fs2-aws.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/Dwolla/fs2-aws/blob/master/LICENSE)

Utility classes for working with the [Java AWS SDKs](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java) from Scala using [fs2](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2).

Projects including this library will also need to explicitly include the AWS SDK libraries they will rely on, to avoid inadvertently importing more libraries than are required.
